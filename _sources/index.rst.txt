Welcome to the B&D coding standards documentation
=================================================

This is a very opiniated collection of best practices, style guides and preferred libraries.

However, to quote `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds>`_

.. note::

   A style guide is about consistency. 
   Consistency with this style guide is important. 
   Consistency within a project is more important. 
   Consistency within one module or function is the most important.

   However, know when to be inconsistent 
   -- sometimes style guide recommendations just aren't applicable.
   When in doubt, use your best judgment.
