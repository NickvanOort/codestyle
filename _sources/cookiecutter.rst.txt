Data Science cookiecutter
=========================

This template identifies itself as

.. code-block:: text

    A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure 
    for doing and sharing data science work.


To every data science project, there is a typical workflow. You will need to ingest data,
which often needs to be preprocessed before you can start visualizing or predicting.

This process will typically grow organically and iteratively. That means that you will start 
to create functions, extend them, explore and visualize and add some more.

Before you know it, your project has grown into a jungle of jupyter notebooks, with preprocessing,
visualization and models all interconnected. Reproducing the exact steps might become difficult,
especially if someone else picks up your project, especially after 6 months...

So, using a cookiecutter is not just for yourself: other people will thank you because the structure
of your code is self explanatory.

Also, you will thank you, because after a few months it can be very hard to figure out what the correct
order or structure was. With the data science cookiecutter structure, you will have a flexible framework
that is strong enough to be used all the way to a stand-alone python module.

Setup
-----

First, you should install cookiecutter with either ``poetry add cookiecutter --dev`` to install it to your project,
or ``pip install cookiecutter`` to install cookiecutter globally (which could makes sense).

After that, setting up a template is as simple as

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science

This will install a complete template. It will add a README file that explains the structure; in 
addition to that, you can read more details in the `datascience cookiecutter docs <https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/>`_
